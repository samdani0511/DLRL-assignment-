## Overview
This repository contains multiple **AI and Machine Learning projects** that I have developed, improved, and optimized.  
The projects cover a wide range of topics including:

- **Time Series Prediction** using LSTM.
- **Text Generation and NLP** using RNN.
- **Reinforcement Learning** for games like Tic-Tac-Toe.
- **Data Processing, Model Training, and Evaluation** techniques.

For each project, I have implemented improvements to enhance:

- Code readability, modularity, and maintainability.
- Training efficiency and model performance.
- User interaction and visualization.
- Compatibility with platforms like **Google Colab** for easy execution.

## Features

- Preprocessing pipelines for structured and unstructured data.
- Implementation of deep learning models (LSTM, RNN, Dense networks).
- Reinforcement Learning agents with policy saving/loading.
- Interactive interfaces for human interaction with AI.
- Visualization of predictions and training progress.

## Colab Notebooks

All projects are designed to run in **Google Colab**, making it easy to execute and experiment:
